# Wave Particle Duality

## Introduction

This repo was made to test the Claude.ai engine. The site provided is a debugged and modified output from claude.ai follow the prompt below:


I would like to build a website that teaches a students about the wavelike properties of particles in classical, relativistic, and quantum mechanics. The website should be interactable and provide animated examples as well as equations and a history on who discovered these concepts. Please cite any famous experiments and why they were so groundbreaking to the study of physics and wave mechanics for quantum. The final output should have html, css, and js files that I can download.

## Process

Claude.ai has limits to how many lines it can write on a given prompt. I was forced to break up my requests in order to complete the javascript functions and animations I was looking to add to this exercise. The initial output only provided half of the html and a quarter of the javascript required for the finished product given constraints using the free version of Claude.ai v3.7. Over additional iterations and some debugging for mostly syntax errors I was able to produce a fully functioning page with multiple visual examples of the phenomenon described.

## Final thoughts

Claude.ai is a powerful tool and I think it is another tool that should be in a modern developers arsenal. In paid versions it might output full webpages, however, I think it is best used for smaller requests that you can embed rather than building an entire site on its own.
